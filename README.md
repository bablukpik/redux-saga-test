# Redux Saga
## What is Redux Saga?
Redux-saga is a redux middleware library, that is designed to make handling side effects in any redux app. It achieves by using an ES6 feature called Generators, allowing us to handle asynchronous code.
## Why do we need Redux Saga?
The reason that we need to use a middleware such as Redux Saga is because the Redux store only supports synchronous data flow. Redux-Saga is a library that aims to make handling application side effects (e.g., asynchronous actions such as fetching data) easier to handle and more efficient to execute. This is kind of converter as it converts async data flow into sync data flow.
